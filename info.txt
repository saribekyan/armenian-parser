Steps:

0. First find a dataset with short POS tagged sentences and compare it to existing parsers/POS.

1. Label 200-300 sentences manually
    - Look at Penn Treebank for an idea of how to do
    - Need do POS tagging as well (EANC might help)

2. Run state of the art parsers using the manual data to have a baseline.

3. Try to generate parallel text (simple DP)
